## Lists in Python

In Python, a list is created by placing elements inside square brackets [], separated by commas.

### List of integers
```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```
A list can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string, etc.).

### Empty list
An Empty list is defined using:
```py
my_list = []
```

### List with mixed data types
```py
my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.4]
```
A list can also have another list as an item. This is called a nested list.

### Nested list
```py
my_list = ["mouse", [8, 4, 6], ['a']]
```
