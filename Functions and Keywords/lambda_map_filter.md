# Lambda
A lambda function is a small anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression which is its return value.

Example:
```py
square = lambda x : x ** 2
print(square(8))
```

Output:

    64
    
# Map
The map() function takes two parameters:
function - a function that perform some action to each element of an iterable
iterable - an iterable like sets, lists, tuples, etc.

Example continued:
```py
scores = [12, 7, 15, 8]
squared_scores = list(map(square, scores))
print(squared_scores)
```

Output:

    [144, 49, 225, 64]

# Filter
Pythonâ€™s filter() is a built-in function that allows you to process an iterable and extract those items that satisfy a given condition. 
It takes two parameters:
function -  a function that tests each element in the sequence to be true or not.
sequence -  sequence which needs to be filtered, it can be sets, lists, tuples, or containers of any iterators.
        
Example continued:
```py
filtered = [lambda x : x >= 100, squared_scores]
print(filtered)
```

Output:

    [144, 225]
